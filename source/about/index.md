About Me
========

My name is Daniel

I am a British Computer Science Graduate from Aberystwyth University.

Currently working as a System Administrator and Web Developer.

Interests
---------

Having used Linux as my day-to-day operating system for many years, many of my interests are centered around open source software and home hardware projects.

Fire spinning is something I enjoy but having moved somewhere with less outside space have had to move to spinning things that glow rather than those that are alight.
