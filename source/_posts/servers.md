Throughout the course of high-school, college, university and work, being a geeky individual I have accumulated a few computers.  Some of these get used then re-purposed as the times change.
Many of them have moved into the role of server.

These servers perform many different tasks.

A common use of a server in a home is as a media server.  To serve all you music, video and pictures to various devices such as tablets or maybe a television.

## Problem

The main problem I found with accumulating many computers is that they are all different shapes and sizes.

Storing them becomes a pain and if all of them are in use its even more of an issue as you need a lot of space so that they are not blocking each others air flow or just the noise they produce.

## Solution

I wanted to consolidate all of my old hardware into one place.  A common way to do this is to build a rack.  Racks are expensive.

The approach I took was that of buying rack-mount cases and re-housing my existing equipment into these cases.

Found a cheap 1U (single unit) half depth case online and put my old HTPC in it.  At this point I have a rack-mount server but no rack to put it in.

Rack cabinets are very expensive so I followed the trend of making a "Lack-Rack" which is an [Ikea Lack Table](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/80193735) (small coffee table).  These tables are exactly 19 inches wide between the legs so you can just mount a server between them, screwing directly into the legs.

## Result

It turns out the legs on Lack tables used to be solid, but now they are hollow.  As a result they are not strong enough to support a server so I ditched that idea and went with a rack-mount frame.  A cheaper alternative to a cabinet as it is just the structural beams which is enough to mount rack-mount hardware into.

It is 12U tall.  This fits nicely in my living room in a corner hidden by a sofa and a chair.

Yes I keep some servers in my living room...
